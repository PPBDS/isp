## Before Next Time

Think harder about week 3, and what should be completed before then. For example, we might complete both the Quarto Websites Tutorial and the Census I tutorial for Monday of week 3, even though we will not be done with R4DS tutorials. Then, the week could be spent building a quarto websites with census data, which would be a nice project. Then, we would have more time to do proper data science during weeks 4 and 5.

End of week 1, Github/Rpubs using library data
End of week 2, Github/Rpubs using downloaded data
End of week 3, Github/Quarto Website using downloaded census data, perhaps with several different scripts and saved images.

Swap out the Chetty data for regular census data.  Then we could use county census data in primer.data (or, better, stored in r4ds.tutorials) for week one. Provide that data as a csv in week 2. And then dowload that data from the census directly in week 3.


Consider switching to Quarto Pubs for everything.

## Standard Preparations

* Reach out to potential TFs.

* Set up new Github organization under your personal account. Use this for class repos. Follow bootcamp-2023-01 as a naming convention

* Create a new location for example reprexes at R Studio Community. Here is the most recent one: https://community.rstudio.com/t/thread-for-students-in-kanes-data-science-bootcamp-to-post-example-questions/140111

* Update link in Getting Help tutorial with this new location.

* Update link in Final Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet students fill out.

* Set up empty project for first class so your set up looks like student set up.

* Be careful about forks. If you have students fork from repo class-2022-08-01, you can not then change the name of this tutorial to class-2022-08-02 and then have them fork from it again. The reason is that these are the same repo, but with a name change, and you can't fork twice from the same repo.

* Don't forget to make TFs co-hosts on the first day so that they can move from room to room.


## Week 1

### Day 1

#### Preceptor's Notes

Call me "Preceptor."

No six week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

Video on --- unless there is something going on in your life which prevents it. In which case, discuss with a TF.

Class always begins by looking at the Preceptor's Notes for the day, available here, in Discord.

0) After today, we start on time, often by going to breakout rooms immediately. Let's go now! Introduce yourself to your fellow students. TFs will try and swing by.

1) Links to consider today:

Bootcamp: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/
Schedule: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html
R4DS: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/
Final projects: https://davidkane.info/files/final_projects.html

2) Second trip to breakout rooms. Introduce yourselves again but, this time, write down the names of the students in your room and how they found out about the course. I will randomly call on some students to report this info when I bring the class back together.

3) Submit the assignments or you will be removed from the class. Central metaphor of the class is Ulysses and the Sirens. There are several tutorials due on Wednesday before class. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Most important tutorial is RStudio and Code.

4) Ask lots of questions on Discord. Other students benefit from both your question and the resulting answers.

5) Answer lots of questions on Discord! Your fellow students (and I) appreciate it. Moreover, you only really understand something once you have taught it.

6) It is always a good idea to reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

If you have problems, it is sometimes necessary to remove the package first:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")

7) Start the Data visualization tutorial together. 

8) Zoom links for meetings are always in the Discord #⁠announcements channel.



#### TF Notes

Make sure, in this class and future ones, that I (or someone else) turn you into a co-host so that you can move from room to room. I will usually turn one TF into the host and then have him do this. When you are done, you turn me into the host again.

Identify a final project or two which you like and which you think are well done. It is OK if one of the projects is yours. Indeed, you should probably clean up your own final project just in case students want to look at it!

I will assign breakout rooms in the order in which you are appear in the staff listing: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/staff.html. You might be responsible for anywhere from 1 to 5 rooms, but they will always be continuous and in staff order. So, if you are the second person listed, and I assigned 3 rooms per TF, then you would get rooms 4, 5 and 6. (I am not assigned any specific rooms, at least today. I move all over.)

You should do more talking/directing today than you will do later. Indeed, you are talking almost all the time when you are in a room today. (This is totally different from later in the session, when you might say very little, allowing students to run the breakout rooms themselves.) Tell a different student to share their screen each time. Tell another student to do the "driving," to tell the first student what to click on. This might seem weird since we are mostly looking at final projects from past years, but we want them to get into practice. So, have the driver say, "Click on the About tab," for example. 

Key goal for today is to help them decide if they should take the course. Please help them! Tell them about the interactive nature of class. Warn them about video always on and cold-calling. Tell them about the tutorials. Show them the final projects.

Make sure your display name in Discord is the name by which students know you, could be just your first name or your whole name. Should not be something opaque. 

For the first class or two, I will make sure that the number of breakout rooms created is a multiple of the number of TFs. (This year that number is 5, at least on the first day.) You are responsible for the set of rooms in the order in which your photos appear on the same page. So, for example, if there are 20 rooms and 5 TFs, Yuhan would get rooms 1-4, Alex would get rooms 5-8 and so on.

#### Lecture Notes

Go through name/email on tutorial together. Then send them to breakout rooms to do exercises 1 - 5, and then stop there. Talk about final projects. Do 6 with them together. Have about 5 people in each room because there will be more than 1 person who has not done the installation. 


### Day 2

#### Preceptor's Notes

Call me "Preceptor."

0) If possible, please change your Discord and Zoom display name to be the name which we should use in addressing you. We are a community! 

1) Big thanks to all the students (including Joshua, Dylan A, Matthew Ng, Natalie, harnoor, Alan Cai, Rishi S, Xamin, Hafsah K and others) using Discord. Much appreciated, especially those answering questions! You are a good person to do so. And, also, you only really understand something once you have explained it to someone else. See, do, teach. 

2) It is always a good idea to reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

If you have problems, it is sometimes necessary to remove the package first:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")

3) In the breakout rooms, one person shares a screen and the others tell her what to type. Then, next time, someone else shares.

4) Thanks for all the great comments/questions and bug reports on the tutorials. Much appreciated! We will fix these.

5) Start thinking about the topic for your final project. What are you interested in? Is there data about it?

6) In the first class, we just worked from the Console. Today, we go "one level up" and work from a script within an R project. Tomorrow, we go one more level up, start with Github and work on Quarto document within an R project.

8) We will be assigning permanent breakout rooms. If there is a student in whose room you would like to be (or a TF you would like to work with), email Anish at ani.bellamkonda@gmail.com before midnight Thursday.

9) Never stress about the tutorials! Just do your best. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Ask lots of questions on Discord.

#### TF Notes

Goal for today is to start with nothing and then finish with a nice looking plot on the student's computer. (We don't have enough time to post the plot to Rpubs.) Today, we start with a new project. Tomorrow, we start with a new Github repo. 

We spend all of Day 2 working in an R script. Nail down the distinction between a text file and the Console. Get good at command-return as well as sourcing a whole file, much as is done in the RStudio and Code tutorial. Make them restart their R sessions multiple times.

If there are specific students you want to work with, let Anish (ani.bellamkonda@gmail.com) know.

I will not have dedicated rooms assigned. Instead, I will try to visit all the rooms. I expect that we will have 10 rooms total, with 2 rooms each for the 5 TFs tonight. But, if only 25 kids show up, we might go down to 5 rooms total.

I will move from room to room. Let me know when I arrive if there is anything you want me to discuss. 




### Day 3

#### Preceptor's Notes

Fill out this form about breakout rooms. 

https://forms.gle/xtVzQainfpsKXbTP6

We will assign rooms for Monday. You must have caught up on the tutorials by Monday in order to stay in the course.

0) For Monday, from the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the *Terminal* tutorial. Also complete the tutorials associated with the readings: Data Import and Getting Help. Note that the Terminal tutorial is at the end of the r4ds.tutorials collection.

1) Apologies to the many students who are caught up. This is the last time that we will slow down the class in order to take care of students who have not done the work. Let's go to breakout rooms and ensure that everyone has a free www.github.com account. 

2) For picking final projects, ask yourself some questions: What topic are you most interested in? What do you follow on social media? What do you care about even though no one is forcing you to care about it? Tell us, and we can help you find relevant data. Use the #final-projects channel on Discord.

3) Catch up with the tutorials before Monday or you will be removed from class. Note that there are several tutorials due on Monday. You have done the RStudio and Github tutorial, right? If not, pay attention now!

4) Goal today is to publish an interesting graphic relating population to economic connectedness across US counties.


#### TF Notes




## Week 2

Monday: Get the data downloaded and placed in a data directory.

Wednesday: Fork the repo from Monday, read in the data and, hopefully, get as far as creating a new state variable.

Thursday: Use the same project as Wednesday. Calculate the state-level statistics and make a nice plot. Publish it to Rpubs.

See the daily scripts for more details. Key things this week are getting comfortable with rendering qmd, using Git/Github and then publishing the page to the web. All week is answering the question: Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state?


### Day 4

0) We will try out permanent breakout room assignments. See here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fEYkLTTIQKPFeFhVJ3ifx9iDTrK454rFQVZG8hImUuw/. Find your room. Add your email address. If your name is not listed, add yourself to the room with the fewest students. Start with Room 5.

1) Big thanks to those (including Joshua, Nick, Natalie and others) pointing our typos and errors in the tutorials, and to those helping out their classmates. Much appreciated.

2) Whenever starting a new tutorial, please:

install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

Do it now! (Never hurts.) And restart R with Command-shift-0. Note that this is zero not the letter O.

3) Key question this week: Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state?

4) Key goal today is to practice some of the techniques you learned in the Terminal tutorial. You completed that right? If your on Windows, use https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/

5) See the #class-work channel for the data file which we will be downloading and the plot which I hope to get to. #announcements provides a link for the room assignments.

6) Review assignments for this week. Several of the tutorials are unfinished. One is barely started. Just do whatever is there.

7) Final projects?



### Day 5

-1) Thanks to everyone (Alan Tao, Pranav C, Rishi S, vibha24, ricesucker2000, Pratham, and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated! Also, thanks to everyone for pointing out errors in the tutorials. 

0) Sign up for https://chat.openai.com/ now.

1)  Always reinstall the tutorials before starting a new tutorial. It certain weird situations, it may be necessary to explicitly remove and then reinstall:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

2) Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state?

3) Posit Cloud (https://posit.cloud/) is an option for people with computer problems. (Posit is the company behind RStudio.) 

4) Whenever you, after asking a question on Discord, figure something out, please edit/update your question with the correct answer.

5) Let's learn how to delete a repo. Keep your Github account clean.

6) Let's learn how to fork a repo: 

https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2023/class-2023-06-12

Connect this to a new RStudio project. Data science work often begins with a fork like this. Is there a relationship between the total population in a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in the state?



### Day 6


1) Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state? See #class-work channel for my plot.

2) Final Project presentations (Demo Day) on Wednesday July 12.

3) Call me "Preceptor."

4) Data Elixir (https://dataelixir.com/) and Data is Plural (https://www.data-is-plural.com/) are great sources for data. 

5) Always reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before starting a new tutorial.

6) Let's get to know each other better. Go to the breakout rooms and have everyone say where they are and how they found out about the course.


## Week 3

Las week, we started with nothing, created a project, downloaded some data, read in the data, did some wrangling, made a nice plot and put it on the web. Good stuff! 

This week, we do it all again. In the next session, we should ensure that we do Census I for Monday. Then, this week's project builds a nice map of census data. 





### Day 7

1) Thanks to everyone (Rishi S, Alan Tao, Alan Cai, vibha24, susuwatari, cindyqiao, satvik, Aryan, Pratham, Luit Deka  and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated! Also, thanks to everyone for pointing out errors in the tutorials. 

2) Want to do a data science apprenticeship with me this summer? You now have enough background to do so, starting either now (while you take the course) or after the course ends. More details: https://davidkane.substack.com/p/data-science-apprenticeships

3) Happy Git and GitHub for the useR is an incredible resource: https://happygitwithr.com/. 

4) Discuss your ideas for projects. Look at what students have done in prior sessions: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html

5) Review schedule for this week: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html

Class Github: 
Class website: 

### Day 8

0) Make sure you complete the Quarto Websites (chapter 7) tutorial for Thursday class. We will be making a website in class tomorrow.

1) If you are using Posit Cloud, make sure to understand how it works and to set up everything before class.

2) There are lots of CRAN packages which specialize in different types of data. Google is your friend! Examples:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/worldfootballR/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oce/index.html

3) Lots of cool stuff at CRAN Task Views: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ 

4) Please

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

before you start the tutorial. Of course, you should do this before each tutorial, including tutorials from other packages like primer.tutorials and tidycensus.tutorials.

5) Apologies that we are working on the tutorials now, but, as I mentioned at the start, we are making major changes in the course this session.

Class Github: 
Class website: 

### Day 9

0) Ask questions in public Discord. Don't DM me (except for personal issues). Why? I want other people to check out your approach. Maybe there is something for them to learn! I also want them to try to answer questions. That is how you really learn.

1) If you are having trouble making quarto websites (see the discussion in the ⁠tutorials channel), you may want to update your Quarto installation. Go here to do so: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. Run `quarto -v` from the Terminal to see what version you are using.

2) If you are using Windows, make sure that you installed RTools, as instructed in the Getting Started Chapter in the Primer.

3) Update all the tutorials, including all.primer and tidycensus.

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/tidycensus.tutorials")

Class Github: 
Class website: 


## Week 4

Note that this will be week 3 next time, without the data science stuff.

Key goal is to show them how to build a final project, from start to finish. First day is just building a Quarto website. This should go fairly fast since they all should have done it in the tutorial already. We do the exact same thing on days 11 and 12, going faster each time and leaving more time for discussion and playing around with the resulting website. 

Whole thing worked very well last time. It is really good to make them comfortable making websites. It is really good to show them how to split out component parts in scripts like download-data.R and make-plots.R.


### Day 10

-1) Students in Room 6 (normally) should move to Room 5 for today.

0) Thanks to shah nawaz, cindyqiao, Gaurinath Subash, Nick, vibha24, Rishi S, susuwatari and others for doing such a great job on Discord. Much appreciated! 

1) What is the causal effect of male age on female age across US counties? Think about the units, outcomes, covariates and (sometimes) treatments. What are the potential outcomes? Go to breakout rooms, share a screen, and write down some answers. Everyone write. I will call on students at random when we come back to the main room.

2) Let's make a website, and hope it works this time!

3) Some useful download code:

```
library(tidycensus)
x <- get_decennial(geography = "county", 
                   variables = c(population = "P001001", 
                                 med_age_male = "P013002", 
                                 med_age_female = "P013003"), 
                   year = 2010, 
                   output = "wide")
```



4) Create a scatter plot which of male median ages versus female median ages across US counties.


Class Github: 
Class website: 

### Day 11

0) Always start a data science project the same way: New Repo -> New R project -> New Quarto Document.

What is the average causal effect of hearing Spanish on attitudes toward immigration among students in this class? 

Write down the units, treatments and outcomes. What does the Preceptor Table look like?

1) Grab the latest version of the **primer.data** package, if necessary

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.data")

But you probably already have the latest version.

2) Explore the `trains` tibble. This was used extensively in Chapter 1 of the Primer. Focus on the key variables: treatment, att_end, gender. Look at the help page.

3) Recall some of the key concepts to doing data science: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/glossary.html

Class Github: 


### Day 12

0) We need the rstanarm library. If `library(rstanarm)` fails, you need to install it with `install.packages("rstanarm")`.

1) Fill out your name and email on this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12K7i51n9IOVlPbZ6gSEp2UUiC5vLZSr86X6hDM3E3CU/edit?usp=sharing

Later in class, we will give you time to add information about your final project.

2) You must have your final project data ready to work with for Monday's class!

3) Consider the schedule: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html

4) The Key Concept page is very handy: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/glossary.html



## Week 5

For next time, note that you can only get through Wisdom and Justice in the first day this week. There is so much to talk about! But, given that, you can start with a model which has two indepedent varables even though the students will not have officially read that chapter until Wednesday.

Also, the pulse ~ gender and age seems like a good model to work with. Or maybe save that addition for Thursday. That is, on Wednesday, just do Courage and Temperance for the model pulse ~ 1 model we started with. Then, on Thursday do a full model from start to finish, sort of an example for their final projects. 


### Day 13

0) Make sure you have filled out this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12K7i51n9IOVlPbZ6gSEp2UUiC5vLZSr86X6hDM3E3CU

1) Is your outcome really an "outcome?" It must be a variable, some column in the data which you propose to use. It must be possible to explain/predict using some other variables (the covariates) in the data you have. Most of the current outcomes are not outcomes . . . Example: "NBA Best Starting Lineup based on 2022-23 Stats" is not an outcome.

2) Once you have a model which uses the variables you have to model/forecast the outcome, then you can use that model to answer all sorts of interesting questions. For example, if you have a measure of basketball skill (as an outcome) which can be modeled as a function of covariates, then you can use that model to predict/explain skill in the future. Such a model could be used to, for example, predict the 5 best players next year.

3) It is often a good idea to start with an interestingd data set (in an area in which you are interested) rather than start with a question and then look for data to answer that question. Most questions do not have data available for answering them! But every data set generates interesting questions to answer. 

4) An example source: https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/. Another source: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html. Pick any data set and outcome variable NOW!

5) Use `nhanes` tibble from **primer.data** to answer this question: What is the difference in pulse rate between two randomly selected female students in this class? 

6) Start a data science project. Repo -> Project -> Quarto. Load up nhanes tibble from the primer.data package. Explore the data, especially pulse and gender.

### Day 14

0) Make sure that you have an outcome variable and a data set: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12K7i51n9IOVlPbZ6gSEp2UUiC5vLZSr86X6hDM3E3CU

1) Before class tomorrow, add a link to the Proof of Fit section demonstrating that you have used your data and your outcome variable to fit a model.

2) You proof-of-fitted-model should look something like: https://rpubs.com/dkane/example

3) Today, we dive into Courage and Temperance, picking up where we left off on Monday.

Class Github:


### Day 15




## Week 6

This week is all about making Demo Day a success.


### Day 1

1) Check out the final projects: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcbtBdRiSOq4ZuEIs032XNxB9O7GndCBSEMWzJlZuhc

2) All my/TF comments today will seem more critical than we intend them to be. Sorry! We love your projects and all the hard work you have done. Our comments are meant to be constructive, but they will mostly be things you should change . . .

3) You must invite at least one friend or family member to Demo Day. Be sure to cc Preceptor and your TF. Relevant emails:  

Below is a draft email. Modify as you like. We will send this email during class tonight.

---
Please come watch me present my final project for Kane’s Data Science Course at 8:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, July, 12. Links: 

Zoom: https://shorturl.at/gmnB5
Background: bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

I don't know whether I will be presenting at 8:00 or 8:30, but I can update you about that on Wednesday.

No worries if you can't make it!
---

2) Goal today is to take a look at everyone's draft project. We will do practice presentations on Tuesday and then public presentations on Wednesday. The definition of successfully completing the course is to present your final project.

4) Make sure to read and follow the Style Guide: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html

5) Make sure you have as many lines of comments as you have lines of code. There is no better way to distinguish between student and professional code than by looking at the comments.

### TF Notes

Goal is to help students have a succesful final project. We do this by both helping them directly but also be highlighting cool stuff in other students' projects. After all, if student A is making interesting use of animation, there is still time for student B to add animation to his final project. 

The culture of data science is one that encourages inspiration from other data scientists!

Make sure to point out errors in following the Style Guide. Tell students to read it!

Tell students to write comments. In fact, spend 10 minutes during your breakout room having all students add comments. And then walk through those comments, giving feedback.

Discuss students' 5 sentence summaries. Focus on the takeaway point. What is the one sentence which they hope viewers will take away from their project?

Review the submissions to the spreadsheet. Several are not following the instructions. Ensure that they do. 


### Day 2

1) Please fill out the final project spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcbtBdRiSOq4ZuEIs032XNxB9O7GndCBSEMWzJlZuhc

If you have already filled it out, please check that your information is correct. Please follow the instructions at the top!

2) Want to thank me or the TFs? Run this code:

Sys.Date() + runif(n = 1, min = 365*5, max = 365*10)

This is a random day sometime in the range of 5 to 10 years from now. Add a note in your calendar for that date to send us a thank you email, letting us know what you are up to, with data science or anything else. Good teachers love to hear from their former students!

3) Read about the Demo Day procedures:

https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

With bigger classes, we would practice this today, but perhaps that is not necessary. We will be done by 9:00 PM. If you would like to go in the first batch, please email me.

4) Keep working on your projects. Ask questions! 

5) In breakout rooms, take turns starting your presentations. Say your five sentences. Say them again. Make them fluent. No uhs and ahs. Memorize the sentences, but don't say them like a machine.

6) Look at each other's code. Do you have enough comments? Do you follow the Style Guide? Look at each other's repos. Are the organized? Can we fork them and reproduce your results?


### Day 3: Demo Day!

1) Share the room assignments with your guests.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c_QJHWnJHcFH2jlgLEbyAgjKhfQBgji7WOeOTy_1qe8

#### TFs

Make sure that you travel in reverse room numerical order. (I prefer that you move in the opposite order to the students so that you are with different students each time.) That is, if you start in room 3, then you move to room 2 next, and so on.

It is your job to ensure that each presentation is interactive. It is boring for everyone involved if the presenting students just talks and talks. No one is listening! And they know it! Instead, it is up to you to ensure that everyone (and you) ask lots of questions. The presenter should never talk for more than 30 seconds straight.
