# This is a collection of Preceptor's Notes for use before class. 
# This is a text document because the contents need to be copy/pasted into Discord.


## Next Time

Make more use of #projects channel as a location for students to prove that they 
have made progress on the projects, and do it earlier in the course.

## Outline

See the big_picture.txt file.

End of week 1, Github/Rpubs using library data
End of week 2, Github/Rpubs using downloaded data
End of week 3, Github/Quarto Website. Three different practice websites, each time using a potential data type: census, tidytext, and . . .


## Standard Preparations

* Reach out to potential TFs. Check to see if any are interested in younger or 
older breakout rooms. Confirm that they are all available on Demo Days.

* Make sure all TFs appear on the staff page, with their emails.

* Set up new Github organization under your personal account. Use this for class 
repos. Follow bootcamp-2023-01 as a naming convention https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024

* Create a new location for example reprexes at Posit Community for the Getting 
Help tutorial. Here is the most recent one: https://forum.posit.co/t/thread-for-students-posting-practice-reprexes-please-do-not-answer-them/187087

* Update link in Getting Help tutorial with this new location.

* Update link in Data Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet students fill out.

* Update link in Final Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet.

* Update link in Terminal tutorial (and Primer) for rtools.

* Set up empty project for first class so your set up looks like student set up.

* Be careful about forks. If you have students fork from repo class-2022-08-01, 
you can not then change the name of this tutorial to class-2022-08-02 and then 
have them fork from it again. The reason is that these are the same repo, but 
with a name change, and you can't fork twice from the same repo.

# First TF Meeting

Confirm that everyone can see #staff channel and that their Discord display name is sensible.

```
\nick name-you-want
```

Confirm that everyone has a sensible Zoom display name.

Confirm that everyone can attend Demo Days.


Anyone interested in Older breakout room? Younger room?

We will be making extensive use of AI. I recommend the free version of ChatGPT. 
Unless you feel strongly, use this so students can do the same. But, if you are 
using a paid version of this, or another AI, that is fine to. 

Thanks to Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) for volunteering to be Head TF. 

Show breakout room spreadsheet, including TF schedule sheet. Fill out attendance 
spreadsheet as best as possible. You can change it later.


Code for creating the class list:

set.seed(9)
x |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(! information_name %in% c("Luit Deka", "Aditya Chaudhary", "Alan Cai", "Monish Malla", "Atharva Bir Dutta")) |> 
  slice_sample(prop = 1) |> 
  select(information_name, information_email) |>  
  distinct(information_email, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
  write_csv("~/Downloads/class.csv") -> y
  

## Week 1

### Email with Zoom Link for First Class

This email is going out to all the students who have completed the first homework assignment. Please read it closely and follow all the instructions.

0) Call me "Preceptor," not "David" nor "Mr. Kane" nor "Bro."

1) Class today at 8:00 PM EST at 

https://harvard.zoom.us/j/92188147735?pwd=STOd2TSKEm2hVcpygA9NvbnwoA4wIr.1

Be early, not late. I will often shut the room at 8:01 and not allow anyone to attend late. Make sure that you have updated your Zoom client ahead of time.

2) Login in to our Discord server at:

https://discord.gg/GWPYn3pG

We distribute class material on Discord, so you must use it.

3) If you are 15 or younger (or 30 or older), please email Head TF Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) with your name/email and age. We are organizing the groups by age, at least at the extremes. Even better is to DM Tejas this information on Discord itself.

4) To attend class on Wednesday, you must complete the homework for Wednesday by midnight on Tuesday. Feel free to start now.

I look forward to meeting you tonight!

Preceptor

# Part I

The goal for the first part of the course is to get good enough at 
R/RStudio/Git/Github that you can create an high quality data project with an 
associated webpage. The key materials are R4DS and r4ds.tutorials.

## Week 1

### Day 1

Call me "Preceptor."

No eight week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

Video on --- unless there is something going on in your life which prevents it. In which case, discuss with a TF.

Class always begins by looking at the Preceptor's Notes for the day, available here, in Discord.

1) After today, we start on time, often by going to breakout rooms immediately. Let's go now! Introduce yourself to your fellow students with one sentence. TFs will try and swing by. Your room assignment is specified on the spreadsheet in the course #announcements channel on Discord.  

2) Links to consider today:

NYT article: https://shorturl.at/o4b0n
NYT article (pdf): https://shorturl.at/SBLCF

3) Update this package now from the R Console.

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/tutorial.helpers")
```

This should be the last time you need to mess with this package.

4) Submit the assignments or you will be removed from the class. Central metaphor of the class is Ulysses and the Sirens. There are several tutorials due on Wednesday before class. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Don't forget to answer the questions about your name, email and the number of minutes it took to complete the tutorial. 

Use the default name for your HTML submissions, e.g., `rstudio-and-code_answers.html`

5) Sign up for free version of chatGPT (https://chatgpt.com/), or the equivalent.

6) It is always a good idea to reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")
```


### Day 2


0) Big thanks to e_jesse for pointing out typos/errors in the tutorials. Much appreciated!

1) If possible, please change your Discord and Zoom display name to be the name which we should use in addressing you. We are a community! 

2) Big thanks to all the students (including Ethan K, Memo$taylooted, Aedan, basing my data, Jammy_john, chezbanana25, and others) using Discord. Much appreciated, especially those answering questions! You are a good person to do so. And, also, you only really understand something once you have explained it to someone else. See. Do. Teach. 

3) Make friends with the students in your breakout room. If you miss class, you can check with them about what happened. And it is OK to miss class on occasion. You have other obligations! But email Tejas and your TF ahead of time so that we know.

4) It is always a good idea to reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

If you have problems, it is sometimes necessary to remove the package first:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")

5) Never stress about the tutorials! Just do your best. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Ask lots of questions on Discord.

6) In the breakout rooms, one person shares a screen and the others tell her what to type. Then, next time, someone else shares and a different person "drives." If you are sharing your screen, you never type anything unless you are told explicitly to do so.

7) Start thinking about the topic for your final project. What are you interested in? Is there data about it?

8) In the first class, we just worked from the Console. Today, we go "one level up" and work from a Quarto document within an R project. 



### Day 3


0) If you need to miss class, email Tejas and your TF. Missing class (on occasion) is OK! School, family and prom (!) come first. Not submitting your homework will cause me to remove you from the course.

1) Ask lots of questions on Discord. Other students benefit from both your question and the resulting answers. Answer lots of questions on Discord! Your fellow students (and I) appreciate it. Moreover, you only really understand something once you have taught it. See. Do. Teach.

2) Thanks to Ethan, SriRitvik, Eric, Leo, Thomas S, Ethan K, Shyamali Sheth and others for participating on Discord!

3) For picking final projects, ask yourself some questions: What topic are you most interested in? What do you follow on social media? What do you care about even though no one is forcing you to care about it? Tell us, and we can help you find relevant data. Use the #final-projects channel on Discord.

4) Before you start a new tutorial (but after you have finished/submitted other tutorials), run:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

5) In the first class, we just worked from the Console. On day 2, we went "one level up" and worked from a Quarto Document within an R project. Today, we go one more level up, start with Github.

6) Goal today is to publish an interesting graphic relating population to economic connectedness across US counties. See the #class-work channel.

7) You must catch up with all homework, including the three tutorials due for Monday's class, by midnight EDT on Sunday. 

Read Chapters 5, 6, and 7 from R for Data Science (2e), and from the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the tutorials associated with the readings: “Data Tidying,” “Terminal,” and “Data Import.”


## Week 2

Monday: Get the data downloaded and placed in a data directory.

Wednesday: Fork the repo from Monday, read in the data. Explore and understand the data. Maybe make some rough plots.

Thursday: Use the same project as Wednesday. Make a nice plot. Publish it to Rpubs.

See the daily scripts for more details. Key things this week are getting comfortable with rendering qmd, using Git/Github and then publishing the page to the web. 


### Day 4

Call me "Preceptor."

No eight week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

0) Tell your TF and Tejas (not me) if you will be missing a class, need an extension on the assignments and so on. They are nice people! They will always say "Yes," but you need to tell/ask them.

1) Big thanks to those (including Yesmine, Sophia Y, meow, Joshua, Nick, Natalie and others) pointing our typos and errors in the tutorials, and to those helping out their classmates. Much appreciated.

2) New version of tutorial.tidycensus is available. Install it now:

install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

3) Whenever starting a new R4DS tutorial, please:

install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

Do it now! (Never hurts.) And restart R with Command-shift-0. Note that this is zero not the letter O.

3) Key goal today is to practice some of the techniques you learned in the Terminal tutorial. You completed that right . . .

4) File we will be using:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.data/master/data-raw/nyc_tracts.csv 

5) This is sloppy. Stop doing it:

Removing file(s) 'data-import_answers - aditya raut - Aditya Raut.html', 'data-import_answers - astrxr.html', 'data-import_answers - Ethan Koshy.html', 'data-tidying_answers - Ethan Koshy.html', 'data-tidying_answers - kushal kanuparthi.html', 'terminal_answers - Ivy S.html', 'terminal_answers - Kushagra Singh.html', 'terminal_answers - kushal kanuparthi.html', 'terminal_answers - Phanithan K(1).html' due to missing key variables.

6) Make your Zoom and Discord display name the same thing as how you want to be addressed.

### Day 5

1) Uhappy with your Zoom room? No worries! Not all students work well together. Email Tejas and your TF together and they will adjust for Thursday.

2) Thanks to everyone (Rajeev, Dinesh Satyavolu, Leo, Sanaka, e_jesse, Sophia Y, Melody, Adhi, John Menzies, Aditya, Jacob, and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated!

3) "not trying to be grammar police just wanted to let you know" We need the grammar police! Thanks to everyone for pointing out errors in the tutorials. 

4) "Nvm I figured it out" Tell us what you figured out! Whenever you, after asking a question on Discord, figure something out, please edit/update your question with the correct answer.

5) "You can't copy text. but the way i did it was to take a screenshot and have gpt format the arguments for me." Yes!!! Use Ai every chance you get, anyway you can.

6)  Always reinstall the tutorials before starting a new tutorial. It certain weird situations, it may be necessary to explicitly remove and then reinstall:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

7) Posit Cloud (https://posit.cloud/) is an option for people with computer problems. (Posit is the company behind RStudio.) See: https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/cloud.html

8) Let's learn how to delete a repo. Keep your Github account clean.

9) Let's learn how to fork a repo: 

https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/nyc-census-tracts

Connect this to a new RStudio project. Data science work often begins with a fork like this. 



### Day 6

0) You must catch up with all tutorials by Sunday at midnight, if you want to stay in the course. This includes those tutorials due Monday, especially Quarto. It is unfair to your classmates if you don't. 

1) We will be using the same data as earlier, but downloading it again from a new location. Go to #course-announcements channel.

2) Run `/nick yourname` to change your Discord name in this server. (Thanks to Leo.)

3) Data Project presentations (Demo Day) on Thursday June 27. Read more: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

4) Figure out this weekend a topic for your Data Project, and at least one url with some data. You will need to share that with your classmates on Monday, although you can change your topic later. 

5) Always reinstall, from Github, any tutorial package before starting a new tutorial.

6) "I was curious if I could get an extension on today's homework?" Don't ask me! Ask Tejas and your TF. They are in charge of extensions, attendance, et cetera.


## Week 3

Las week, we started with nothing, created a project, downloaded some data, read in the data, did some wrangling, made a nice plot and put it on the web. Good stuff! 

This week, we do it all again, but with a Quarto website. Not sure if we should try to do multiple websites, one each day. Or just do one. Or do three, but make them increasingly complex. Goal is to make it more likely that their projects go well.





### Day 7

Breakout Rooms: https://shorturl.at/La73d

0) Enter your data project topic and at least one url with relevant data now: https://shorturl.at/WEA6C

1) Thanks to everyone (Adhi and Alan Cai (amazing patience from both!), Aedan, Rajeev, Grant Quattlebaum, Ronit Dash, John Menzies, Deepak, alex, gsheth, and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated! Also, thanks to everyone for pointing out errors in the tutorials. 

2) Kushagra Singh, Ronit Dash, Sharav Joshi: Please follow the instructions: https://discord.com/channels/1066524559240597595/1247676325880402045/1251707786602090506

3) Want to do a data science apprenticeship with me this summer? You now have enough background to do so, starting either now (while you take the course) or after the course ends. More details: https://davidkane.substack.com/p/data-science-apprenticeships. This is only open to people with 30+ hours per week available -- in addition to the 10 you already spend in the course. Email me to discuss. Luit, Anish and Tongyan worked with me last summer. Feel free to ask them about the experience.

4) Happy Git and GitHub for the useR is an incredible resource: https://happygitwithr.com/. 

5) "Ok I goosed around w the website name and hte title in the _quarto.yml file, then deleted the changes I made and re-tried the instructions in the tutorial and it somehow worked" Welcome to professional data science! 

6) "fixed it, but it really is super picky it is about formatting" So true!

7) Begin every project with AI!

### Day 8

1) We have made some changes to the breakout rooms in order to adjust TF workload: https://shorturl.at/La73d. Big change is moving students in room 14 to room 4. Say Hello to Anish!

2) Read the instructions for Demo Day: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

Email your TF now (cc Tejas) to confirm that you will be there.

3) If commands like `quarto preview` and `quarto publish` are giving you trouble, switch to Posit Cloud:  https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/cloud.html 

4) Thanks to Iris Li, John Menzies, Alan Cai, Rajeev, Karam, Dinesh Satyavolu, Zephan, SriRitvik, and others for all their help on Discord. Much appreciated!

5) Please

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

before you start a new tutorial. Of course, you should do this before each tutorial, including tutorials from other packages like primer.tutorials and tidycensus.tutorials.

6) Today, we will make another website, and create another map. We will try the leaflet package. You might need to install it.

7) "I wanted to inform you all that I'm going to be on vacation for the week of June 24th and as a result will miss the presentation day for our final projects." A very professional email sent to me/Tejas and this student's TF. Well done! Family first!

Class Github: 
Class website: 


### Day 9

0) Each group will work with a dataset from a member of their breakout room. Think now about volunteering. Your data must be relatively simple to deal with. (This is a first time experiment for me!)

1) Install the primer.tutorials package. I recently made some changes:

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

2) Due Sunday at midnight:

```
Read chapter 17 from R for Data Science (2e) and, from the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the “Dates and times” tutorial.

Complete the “Data Project” tutorial from the primer.tutorials package. Be sure to reinstall the package before starting the tutorial.
```

If you don't complete these on time, you will be removed from the course.

3) Still having trouble with Quarto website? Most common mistake for Windows users is a failure to install Rtools as explained in the Getting Started chapter in the Primer. Backup plan is to use Posit Cloud.

4) You have read the Demo Day guide, right? https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

5) We will send out invitation emails to our friends and/or family on Monday in class. Decide who you want to invite. Make sure you have their email addresses. I urge you to invite your grandparents. They love you!

AI Log:

## Week 4

Note that this will be week 3 next time, without the data science stuff.

Key goal is to show them how to build a final project, from start to finish. First day is just building a Quarto website. This should go fairly fast since they all should have done it in the tutorial already. We do the exact same thing on days 11 and 12, going faster each time and leaving more time for discussion and playing around with the resulting website. 

Whole thing worked very well last time. It is really good to make them comfortable making websites. It is really good to show them how to split out component parts in scripts like download-data.R and make-plots.R.


### Day 10

Demo Day Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn
Demo Day Projects: https://shorturl.at/guyh3 
Demo Day Zoom: https://shorturl.at/dafDQ

0) Thanks to Eric, Rajeev, Akhil B, shibaaaaaa, Melody, Deepak, Sanaka, SriRitvik, Iris Li, Ronit Dash, John Menzies (especially!) and others for their participation on Discord. Much appreciated!

1) Confirm your attendance (or otherwise) on the Demo Day Room Assignment Sheet: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn

2) Check out the data projects: https://shorturl.at/guyh3 Add your material, even just your name, if you have not already. We need to know who is presenting.

3) All my/TF comments today will seem more critical than we intend them to be. Sorry! We love your projects and all the hard work you have done. Our comments are meant to be constructive, but they will mostly be things you should change . . .

4) You must invite at least one friend or family member to Demo Day. You must bcc Tejas (tejasnm07 at gmail.com) and your TF when you send the email.

Below is a draft email. Modify as you like. We will send this email during class tonight.

---
Please come watch me present my final project for Kane’s Data Science Course at 8:00 PM EDT on Thursday, June 27. Links: 

Zoom: https://shorturl.at/dafDQ
(Draft) Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn
Background: http://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

I don't know whether I will be presenting at 8:00 or 8:30, but I can update you about that on Wednesday.

No worries if you can't make it!
---

4) Goal today is to take a look at everyone's draft project. We will do practice presentations on Wednesday and then public presentations on Thursday. 

5) Make sure to read and follow the Style Guide: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html

6) Make sure you have as many lines of comments as you have lines of code. There is no better way to distinguish between student and professional code than by looking at the comments.

7) Consider splitting your project up, as you learned to do in the Quarto Websites tutorial. You don't want your index.qmd file to take a lot of time to process. Use scripts for data download/cleaning and for graphic creation.



### Day 11

Demo Day Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn
Demo Day Projects: https://shorturl.at/guyh3 
Demo Day Zoom: https://shorturl.at/dafDQ

1) Thank your TFs! Run this code:

```
Sys.Date() + runif(n = 1, min = 365*5, max = 365*6)
```

This is a random day sometime in the range of 5 to 6 years from now. Add a note in your calendar for that date to send us a thank you email, letting your TF know what you are up to, with data science or anything else. Good teachers love to hear from their former students!

2) We will complete this survey in class: https://forms.gle/HWRyTLAjxQxxz5hF9

3) Get ready for vacation! Don't start the primer.tutorials assignments until Wednesday July 10. And, when you start them, make sure to reinstall the package.

4) If you are eager to do some stuff during the vacation, all the r4ds.tutorials are ready to go although, as always, you should reinstall (with remotes:: ...) each time you start a new tutorial. But, before starting any r4ds.tutorials, make sure to 

`install.packages("tutorial.helpers", type = "source")`.

In fact, you should probably do that now. No worries if it fails. Background is that I just released to CRAN a new version of tutorial.helpers which includes show_file(). The package is so new that binary versions of not available yet. That is why we need to use type = "source". If that command fails for you, just wait till this week-end and use just install.packages("tutorial.helpers").

5) Your data for tomorrow is whatever it is. No worries. But your data for the Final Project must be rich enough to allow for the creation of a statistical model. Advice: https://davidkane.info/writings/data-for-projects.html

6) The main project today is to have one person in your breakout room volunteer to have her data project replicated. That means, that everyone else in the group will fork her repo, connect it to an R project on their computer, and then run quarto preview and quarto publish. Good data science is replicable by others. 

In doing this, some warnings. First, delete _publish.yml and rsconnect if the student has (mistakenly) included in in her repo. (She should have included those in her .gitignore file.) Second, it is possible that the student failed to include her data in the repo. Or that she hard-coded some file paths. In any event, trying to replicate someone else's work is a valuable exercise, as is watching/helping someone else trying to rpelicate your work. If someone in the group is having trouble with the replication, help him. If everyone can replicate one student's work, then another student should volunteer. Then, the forking/replication exercise is repeated.

7) Everyone should practice saying (NOT READING) their one paragraph introduction.




# Part 2

The goal for this part for students to be able to take a question and a data set, and then create a statistical model to answer that question. The final result is an high quality website which presents the model and the results. Most important reference: 


## Week 5

Keep in mind that talking about the Cardinal Virtues and a new data science project takes a lot of time. Just having students write down a description of a Preceptor Table is a 5+ minute exercise in the breakout rooms. Try to do Wisdome/Justice on Monday, Courage on Wednesday and Temperance on Thursday, finishing with a Rpubs. (Encourage ambitious students to make a Quarto website.)


On day 1, it is hard to go beyond just describing the Preceptor Table. That is hard for students to do! Maybe next time don't even bother to set up the project till Day 14. Just descibe the questions, the Preceptor Table. Then I describe the data, then ask them to come up with reasons why all the assumptions fail.

### Day 13

Call me Preceptor.

No course does more to increase your odds of getting the future you want.

The central metaphor for this class is Ulysses and the Sirens. You are Ulysses. Ithaca is the future you want. The Sirens are the many distractions of the modern world. I am the rope. 

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today, we start with Wisdom and, I hope, Justice.

1) Start thinking about the data for your Model Project: https://davidkane.info/writings/data-for-projects.html

2) Welcome to our new TFs: Gia Khang and Sanaka Dash!

3) Start a data science project. Repo -> Project -> Quarto Document. Download the data from https://shorturl.at/H0cju. Put in a data/ directory. Edit .gitignore. Commit/push everything. Read in the data. 

4) What is the broad topic/question we are interested in? What is the specific question we will answer? Useful reference: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html#question

5) Describe the Preceptor Table in words. Hint: Think in terms of units, outcomes, covariates, treatments. Useful reference: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html#preceptor-table

6) Explore the data.

7) Write down one reason why validity might not hold.

8) Also, find a reason why stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness might not hold.

Class website: 
Class Github: 
AI Log:

Add Discord post information.


### Day 14

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today, we finish Wisdom and Justice

1) You must have a dataset with an outcome variable and more than 2 covariates by tomorrow. Reminder: https://davidkane.info/writings/data-for-projects.html

2) Zoom work is the same as always. Someone is always sharing a screen. That person does not talk. They just type what the "driver" tells them to type. Everyone else is also typing. Switch the "sharer" and the "driver" often, certainly at least every time we go back to the main room.

3) We will fork this repo: https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/prep-2024-07-17

4) No code today! We are trying to understand conceptual issues. Best guide: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html

5) If your group answers the assigned questions quickly (I will only assign a couple at a time), then load the data and start exploring it. Don't rush through all the questions at once.


### Day 15

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today, we finish with Courage and Temperance.

Goal complete a published Rpubs analysis of the resume experiment. 

1) Repo to fork to begin: https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/prep-resume

2) From Discord: "I mean idk how to delete and reinstall a tutorial" 

Arrg. I have only specified this several times in the Preceptor Notes. Reminder:

```
remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

3) We will discuss model project data sources on Monday. Too much to do today!

4) Courage means coming up with a model. Temperance means using the fitted model, the data generating mechanism, to answer our question.


## Week 6

### Day 16

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. 

1) Please fill out this spreadsheet: https://shorturl.at/mqKea. It is OK if you are not certain what your outcome variable is or which covariates you plan to use. We just want to get a sense of what is in your data. (There should be at least two covariates which help to explain your outcome variable.)

2) See #course-announcements channel for information about this week's data source.

Frederick Mosteller (1995) “The Tennessee study of class size in the early school grades.” The Future of Children, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 113–127. Data cleaned and discussed in "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Kosuke Imai.

3) Please refresh the schedule page weekly. We do make changes! https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html

4) Today we consider Wisdom and Justice. Courage follows on Wednesday, Temperance on Thursdays.


### Day 17

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Today is Courage. Tomorrow is Temperance.

1) Check out the repo from Monday: https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/class-size. Note that the repo is always added to the Preceptor's Notes for that class, after the class is over and I clean things up a bit. Check out my answers to the questions. They aren't the only answers, but they are good.

2) Check out this #course-announcement: https://shorturl.at/f1VTX

3) We need to modify our variables so that things are easier to understand when we create our model.

4)

### Day 18

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Wednesday was Courage. Today is Temperance.

1) Two plots we might make today: https://shorturl.at/qQiov

2) If your breakout room is fast, try to make a nice looking html and publish it to Rpubs. Put a link in the #course-work channel if you succeed. Follow the strategy given in the tutorials, i.e., write a paragraph, add the mathematics of the model, create a gtsummary table and create some nice plots.

3) You don't have to make your code look like mine, but here is my key code from the first two days. Feel free to just copy it so that you are caught up.

AI Log:


## Week 7

Using the governors data set.

### Day 19

1) Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today is Wisdom and Justice. Wednesday is Courage. Thursday is Temperance.

2) Make sure the project spreadsheet is up-to-date: https://shorturl.at/mqKea

3) Homework for Wednesday (chapters 24 and 25) and Thursday (chapters 26 and 27) from R for Data Science.

4) For Wednesday, you must have the results of a call to brm() which you can share with us. 

5) Background on this week's class exercise:

Barfort, S., Klemmensen, R., and Larsen, E. G. (2021). Longevity returns to political office. Political Science Research and Methods 9, 658–664.

https://github.com/PPBDS/primer.data/blob/master/inst/papers/governors.pdf

Does political office cause worse or better longevity prospects? Two perspectives in the literature offer contradicting answers. First, increased income, social status, and political connections obtained through holding office can increase longevity. Second, increased stress and working hours associated with holding office can have detrimental effects on longevity. To provide causal evidence, we exploit a regression dis- continuity design with unique data on the longevity of candidates for US gubernatorial office. The results show that politicians winning a close election live 5–10 years longer than candidates who lose.

### Day 20

1) Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Today is Courage. Tomorrow is Temperance.

2) There is a new version of gtsummary available. Please re-install to be sure that you have it:

```
install.packages("gtsummary")
```

3) My setup code chunk:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(primer.data)
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)
library(gtsummary)

x <- governors |> 
  select(death_age, election_age, win_margin, sex) |> 
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(win_margin > 0, "win", "lose")) |> 
  filter(abs(win_margin) < 5) 
```

### Day 21

1) Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Wednesday was Courage. Today is Temperance.

2) Last homework assignment is Model Project tutorial from primer.tutorials. DO NOT START IT YET. I will finish it by Saturday at midnight and put an note in the #annoucements channel. But no worries. You can't even start this tutorial until you have a draft of your project. Do you have one yet?

3) Put your brm() call and a fixef() of the resulting object into the #projects channel. If you bracket the code with three backticks, it will look nice.

4) I updated the Temperance section of the Cardinal Virtues chapter with a discussion about scaling and intervals. Highly recommended! https://shorturl.at/EXyPu

5) See the analysis.qmd file in my repo if you want a working version of the Courage code from Wednesday.

## Week 8

### Day 1

* Positron, a next-generation data science IDE, will replace RStudio in the next few years, mainly because it works as well with Python as it does with R. It is the future. The next version of this course will probably use it. I recommend you all take a look: https://github.com/posit-dev/positron

* The official definition of completing this class is having a final project listed here: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html

* In order to get your final project listed, you must complete the spreadsheet: https://shorturl.at/6w8vT

* We expect you to present your project on Thursday (Zoom link: https://shorturl.at/WaBub). It is OK if you can't present because of family or other obligations, but, if so, you must email Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) now to tell him so he can set up the breakout rooms correctly.

* Make sure you comment your code: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html#comments

* We are missing some TFs today, so we will need to move Luit's, Anish's, and Vaangmaya's  students to other breakout rooms. Thanks for your flexibility.

* DON'T PANIC! Even if your project is a disaster, there is still time to fix it! First, schedule a meeting with your TF. Second, ask a question on Discord. We are here to help. Third, go to Tejas' office hours tomorrow. Fourth, start with a small sample of your data and a model with just one covariate. (You only need about 1,000 rows for each parameter.) Get that working and then increase the complexity. Fifth, start over! You have my permission to use a data set from a course and make a model similar to (but not identical with!) one of the examples in the course.

* Goal today is to take a tour of various projects. This is mostly TFs sharing their screen and giving feedback on everyone's project. But they will also ask other students to contribute their comments. Be ready to participate. If your room goes fast, then have everyone try to replicate one student's project by forking and then building it themselves. Highly recommended!

### Day 2

* Tell me a number (with a sensible number of signficant digits), and your certainity about that number. Every summary sentence should do this. Data science means numbers, and uncertainty!

* Confirm your participation in Demo Day here: https://shorturl.at/LMVRO

* Make sure that you arrive no later than 7:50 for class tomorrow. Because I have a new Zoom account, I am somewhat concerned about participation limits, so I want to ensure that no students get locked out.

* I am considering teaching two different courses this fall. 

  + This class, but over the course of 12 weeks, with less work each week.
  + An introductory philosophy class which would read some Great Books and then use generative AI to create cool multimedia essays/art.
  
However, I am not sure who would take either class. As you can see, most of my students are in high school or college. Such students are usually too busy to work during the fall semester. I suspect that the most likely potential students would be either home-schooled or at private/charter school (with flexible rules) which might be willing to work with me to teach a group of their students )(for free) all at once.

If you know someone who might be interested (like your uncle works at a high school), please have them email me (dave.kane@gmail.com) to discuss. I will also send out a message about this to the Substack list this week-end.

* Below is a draft email. Modify as you like. We will send this email during class tonight.

Please come watch me present my final project for Kane’s Data Science Course at 8:00 PM EDT on Thursday, August 8. Links: 

Zoom: https://shorturl.at/WaBub
Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/LMVRO
Projects: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html
Background: http://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

I don't know whether I will be presenting at 8:00 or 8:30, but I can update you about that before the presentation.

No worries if you can't make it!
---

* We will do a quick dry run of the start of Demo Day tonight. First, we will all go out to the correct rooms, just to be sure that we can get there. Second, TFs will then adjust room placement depending on who is absent. (They will do this, either by moving someone from the "last" room to the missing spot or, better, by assigning a TF to fill that spot. When the latter happens, the TF will always be in Group B.)

* Then, after some time in the main room, we will practice our presentations a couple of times BUT GOING IN REVERSE ORDER, the better to see different students present. Of course, tomorrow we will go in the correct order. Give good feedback to each other!
