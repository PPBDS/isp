Change the name to: "Introduction to Using AI for Data Science"

Need to advertise more!

Use dakane@ncf.edu in all sign up advertizing, otherwise the NCF enrollment system will break when students seek my permission to enroll in the course using my gmail.


## Priorities for ISP

Confirm students are free at 8:00 PM on Tues Jan 28.
