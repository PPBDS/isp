## Priorities for ISP

Confirm students are free at 8:00 PM on Tues Jan 28.

Does Git/Github work on Posit Cloud?

Set up class list and cold_call function.

Setup Excel spreadsheet for Data and Model Projects.

Fix tutorials for chapters 4 and 5 from Tidycensus.

Redo Git/Github/Quarto tutorials on Posit Cloud. Update instructions if needed.

Why aren't images, like animation.rds, being copied over automatically to _site?

Clean up instructions for Getting Started for users who are on Posit Cloud. Or
maybe update the Posit Cloud instructions. Example: How do you download the 
answers.
