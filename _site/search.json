    "text": "Here are some of my favorite comments from previous students:\n\nThis class is AMAZING!! But a lot of work! Preceptor Kane is amazing! The best teacher I have had.\nPreceptor Kane is one of the best teachers I’ve had at Harvard, if not the best. He genuinely cares about every student and gives everyone every possible chance to succeed.\nTake this class because it will teach you SO MUCH about coding and data science and even life and professionalism — seriously, you won’t believe how much you will improve your data visualization skills in one semester — and because you will get to be taught and mentored by David Kane.\nProfessor Kane is by far my favorite professor I’ve ever encountered at Harvard. No matter your skill level or technical background,he is more than happy to stick with students and catch them up to speed to succeed in the class. Moreover, he genuinely cares about the happiness of his students, fostering a sense of community and ensuring that all students meet each other throughout the semester.\nI loved this course. David Kane is really engaging and a great teacher, and this class has provided me with the most real-world skills of any class here at Harvard.\nThis class is AMAZING!! But a lot of work! Preceptor Kane is amazing! The best teacher I have had.\nThis class is awesome. Would highly recommend to anyone. Don’t let the cold calling and workload scare you, it’s very manageable.\nDoes by far the best job of creating a positive classroom environment of all of the teachers I’ve had. Very accessible outside of class. Teaches applicable, real world skills (even when they don’t relate to the subject matter).\nPreceptor has set the pedagogical bar at Harvard.\n\nRead then all!"

The Sitter stays in one location the entire time.\nFrom the front of the room, I start the Show. The Mover in each pair opens her laptop and presents her project. She will generally have two tabs open on her browser: one for the project website itself and one for her Github repo. After 4 or so minutes, I announce that it is time to switch. The Mover closes her laptop. The Sitter opens his laptop and presents his work. After 4 minutes, I announce that it is time to switch partners.\nThe Mover stands and moves to the closest Sitter in order. That is, we have arranged the pairs of Movers/Sitters in a rough circuit around the room in order to facilitate this exchange, sort of like a game of musical chairs, but with no chairs removed. This may seem complex but it all just sort of works."

    "text": "Advice for Students\nThe only material you need for your presentation is a browser which can show both your project’s webpage and your Github repo. We don’t use Powerpoint or other nonsense.\nEnlarge the image of your project so that the font is large enough for your (older) viewers to read the title, legend and so on. Test how it looks beforehand.\nIn addition to presenting, you will also be listening to presentations by several classmates. Be an engaged listener! Act toward them as you hope they will act toward you.\nMost importantly: ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!\n\nWhen Presenting\nHave fun! Demo Day is a joyful occasion. Your (natural) nervousness is unwarranted. Everyone wants you to succeed. Always start on your project home page. Give your opening paragraph. Pause to see if anyone has any questions. If they don’t, spend another paragraph explaining the details of your main graphic. Pause again. Questions are fun, but you have to give people a chance to ask them.\nWhen pausing, use the “Take a sip of water” technique. Stop talking. Imagine that you are reaching for a class of water, lifting it up, taking a sip, and putting it back down. Only after that can you assume that there are no questions.\nSadly, you will sometimes be stuck with an audience too shy to ask questions. That is OK! One of the things you are learning in this class is how to handle different sorts of audiences. To handle a shy audience, you need to have prepared ahead of time 5 minutes worth of things to talk about. This can, and should, include a tour of your Github repository,\n\n\nWhen Listening\nAlways allow the student you are listening to to give their opening paragraph, perhaps even allowing them a second paragraph to explain their plot. But then interrupt them and ask a question. It doesn’t really matter what the question is. The important thing is to get a conversation going, to demonstrate to guests that questions are welcome and that they should ask some as well."

Take the course! See here for details on my teaching philosophy.\nThere are no prerequisites. The programming language we will be using is R. You must have a computer which can run R, RStudio and Git. We will guide you in the installation of these programs. The course is designed for absolute beginners. Neither programming nor statistics experience is required.\nClass will (tentatively) meet on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday during the first week and on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday thereafter.
