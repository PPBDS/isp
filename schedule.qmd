**DRAFT: I AM WORKING ON THIS.**

Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane, [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker, along with their [their](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) [associated](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/) [tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/). Homework is due before midnight on the day before the class for which it is assigned.

See the home pages for the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

**Always reinstall the relevant package before starting a new tutorial.** Example for **primer.tutorials**:

```
remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

We are always fixing mistakes. You want to use the latest version.

Completed tutorials are submitted via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/G2LeFfJ4CiSuudCe9). If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `getting-started_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `getting-started_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.

The listed assignments are the tutorials. We also recommend that you read the associated chapters in the various textbooks, but there is no reasonable way for us to confirm that you have done so. Tutorial numbers/titles almost always match textbook chapter numbers/titles.


# Week 1

Class will meet in Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

Looking at the data is the first step in data science. Note that Monday's homework must be completed by Sunday at midnight. Email me if you have problems. 

## Monday 

* Set up your laptop by reading the "[Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html)" chapter from the [*Primer*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/).

* Submit the "Getting Started with Tutorials" tutorial from the **tutorial.helpers** package. See the "[Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html)" chapter for details.

* Submit the "Introduction" tutorial from the **r4ds.tutorials** package.

## Tuesday 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete three tutorials: "Data Visualization," "RStudio and Code," and "RStudio and Quarto."

**Reminder**: All work must be completed by midnight the previous evening. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

## Wednesday 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete three tutorials: "Data Transformation," "RStudio and Github Introduction," and "RStudio and Github Advanced."  
 

## Thursday

## Friday 

<!-- DK: Add other chapters. -->

* Read chapters 1 and 2 from from [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker. The U.S. Census is a great source of data for your projects.

* From the [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) package, complete the "An introduction to tidycensus" tutorial.  



# Week 2: January 13

# Week 4: Wisdom

The main focus on the 4th week is individual presentations of your Data Project. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The Data Project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth.
