Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund and [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane. Homework is due before midnight on the day before the class for which it is assigned.

See the home pages for the [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/) and [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/) packages.


Completed tutorials are submitted via [this Google form](). If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in HTML format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `getting-started_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `getting-started_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.

The listed assignments are the tutorials. We also recommend that you read the associated chapters in the *Primer*, but there is no reasonable way for us to confirm that you have done so. 


# Week 1: January 5

Class will meet on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week. However, you still have assignments due everyday.

## Monday 

Set up your computer before class on Monday by reading the "[Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html)" chapter from the [*Primer*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/). Submit the "Getting Started" and "Introduction to R" tutorials from the **[tutorial.helpers](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/)** package.


## Tuesday 

* Complete the "Positron and code" tutorial (`01-code`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.

**Reminder**: All work must be completed by midnight the previous evening. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

## Wednesday 

* Complete the "Positron and Quarto" tutorial (`02-quarto`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.


## Thursday 

 * Complete the "Terminal" tutorial (`03-terminal`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.


## Friday 

 * Complete the "Positron and GitHub Introduction" tutorial (`04-github-1`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.
  

# Week 2: January 12

We meet Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week. But, as always, you have work due every weekday. 


## Monday

 * Complete the "Positron and GitHub Advanced" tutorial (`05-github-2`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.

## Tuesday 

 * Complete the "Quarto Websites Introduction" tutorial (`06-websites-1`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.

## Wednesday

  * Complete the "Quarto Websites Advanced" tutorial (`07-websites-2`) from the **[positron.tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/)** package.

<!-- ## Thursday

# Week 3: January 19

We meet Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday this week. Recall that **assignments are due at midnight on the day before** the relevant class.

<!-- ## Monday

## Tuesday -->

## Wednesday

* Have a rough draft of your project ready to display in class.

* Complete the "Data Project" tutorial from the [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/) package. Be sure to reinstall the package before starting the tutorial. This the second time you have completed this tutorial. 

## Thursday

* Zoom presentation of your second project. I hope that, depending on student schedules, that we will do this in the evening, the better to allow for attendance from your family/friends from home. You are required to invite at least some family members to attend.

## Friday

* In-person presentation of your second project, conducted during class. You are required to invite at least some friends from campus to attend.
