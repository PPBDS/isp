Homework is due before midnight on the day before the class for which it is assigned.

See [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/) for background. You start a tutorial with a command like:

```
learnr::run_tutorial(name = "01-code", 
                     package = "positron.tutorials")
```


Completed tutorials are submitted via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/TzwnpR2g4r2UFDEi7). If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in HTML format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `getting-started_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `getting-started_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.
