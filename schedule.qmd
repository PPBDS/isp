**DRAFT: I AM WORKING ON THIS.**

Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane, [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker, along with their [their](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) [associated](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/) [tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/). Homework should be completed before the class meeting for which it is assigned.

See the home pages for the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

**Always reinstall the relevant package before starting a new tutorial.** Example for **primer.tutorials**:

```
remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

We are always fixing mistakes. You want to use the latest version.

Completed tutorials are submitted via [this Google form](). If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `getting-started_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `getting-started_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.




# Week 1: January 6: Data

Class will meet in Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

Looking at the data is the first step in data science. Note that Monday's homework must be completed before Monday's class. I ensure this by only sending the Zoom link for class to students who submitted the homework.

## Monday 

* Read the Introduction from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Introduction" tutorial. Submit your answers via the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/ScrSYjb6pYPbtvNj7). 

## Thursday 

* Read Chapters 1 -- 4 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete four tutorials: "Data Visualization," "RStudio and Code," "Data Transformation," and "RStudio and Github." Submit your answers via the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/ScrSYjb6pYPbtvNj7). 

**Reminder**: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.


Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up messy data. 

## Monday 

* Read Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), and from the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the tutorials associated with the readings: "Data Tidying," "Terminal," "Data Import," and "Getting Help."   
 

## Thursday 

* Read Chapters 9, 10 and 11 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), and from the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the tutorials associated with the readings: "Layers," "Exploratory Data Analysis," and "Communication."  


* Read chapters 1 and 2 from from [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker. The U.S. Census is a great source of data for your projects.


* From the [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) package, complete the "An introduction to tidycensus" tutorial.  



# Week 2: January 13: Inference

## Monday 

* Read chapters 12, 13, 28 and 29 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and, from the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Logical vectors," "Numbers," and "Quarto Websites" tutorials.

* Come to class with the url for at least one data source you will be using for your Data Project.


## Thursday 

* Read chapters 14, 15 and 16 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and, from the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Strings," "Regular expressions" and "Factors" tutorials. 



# Week 4: Wisdom

The main focus on the 4th week is individual presentations of your Data Project. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The Data Project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your Data Project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers.

<!-- DK: Add back in the final project tutorial. -->

## Monday

* Read chapter 17 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and, from the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Dates and times" tutorial.
