**ROUGH DRAFT: I am adjusting this for our in-person NCF class.**

These are the procedures we follow on "Demo Day" during which students present their projects to an audience of their peers and guests. Demo Day is public. All are welcome. 

The document begins with an overview of the procedures and then provides advice to guests and to students. If you are a guest, you do not need to read the advice for students.

Key request to everyone: ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!

## Overview

Each breakout room will include two students and various guests, both course staff and visitors. 

Basic idea is that all students are in two groups: A and B. Students in Group A present first. We will post the group assignments.

At the start, we are all in the main room. I offer introductions. I open the breakout rooms. Students go to their assigned rooms. (Guests will also go to the room featuring the student they want to listen to.) Chat politely. I will then issue a breakout room message saying to start. The A student presents her work for about 4 minutes. The B student asks a lot of questions. So do the guests. 

After three and a half minutes, I send a Message saying: 30 seconds left. At four minutes, I message “Switch Rooms!”

Please switch rooms when I ask you to!

Student A stays in the room. Student B moves one room up. From room 26 to room 27, for example. (If you are the B student in the highest room, you move to the lowest room number in your grouping which, in this case, might be something like room 22.) Then, Student A presents again.

After 30 minutes of this, the A students will have presented 5 or 6 times. Good stuff! I bring back everyone to the main room. I say a few words. And then we do the whole thing again, with students again starting in the same rooms as in the first round, but, this time, with the B students presenting and staying put in the rooms. And now the A students move from room to room.

After the B students present, I close the breakout rooms, thereby bringing everyone back together. I offer thanks and congratulations.

## Advice for Guests

You need three things: a Zoom link for Demo Day, the breakout room number in which your student is presenting, and whether she is in Group A (presenting first) or Group B (presenting second). 

But please be flexible! We sometimes need a student to switch breakout rooms and/or switch from Group A to B. In Zoom, you should be able to see all the rooms (and who is in them) if you are having trouble finding your student.

If your student is in Group A, please try to arrive on time. If she is in Group B, you can arrive at the start and watch other presentations. Or, you can show up at the class midpoint so that you just watch her presentations.

You can also leave early, once you have seen your student present. (Many parents and grandparents like to watch their student present more than once. This is encouraged.) You are also welcome to check out other student presentations. Just move to any other breakout room whenever you like.

Most importantly: ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!

## Advice for Students

The only material you need for your presentation is a browser which can show both your project's webpage and your Github repo. We don't use Powerpoint or other nonsense.

Enlarge the image of your project so that the font is large enough for your (older) viewers to read the title, legend and so on. Test how it looks beforehand.

Planning is important. Make sure that your TF knows your plans. For example, if a family event prevents you from attending Demo Day, let your TF know as soon as possible. Otherwise, you make her planning much more difficult.

The delicate dance of Demo Day depends on everyone doing their part. You need to show up on time. Otherwise, things get very confusing. If a last-minute emergency arises, email your TF, the head TF and Preceptor as soon as you know that you won't be there.

In addition to presenting, you will also be attending presentations by several classmates. Be an engaged listener! Act toward them as you hope they will act toward you.

Most importantly: ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS! 

### When Presenting

Have fun! Demo Day is a joyful occasion. Your (natural) nervousness is unwarranted. Everyone wants you to succeed. Share your screen the entire time. Always start on your project home page. Give your opening paragraph. Pause to see if anyone has any questions. If they don't, spend another paragraph explaining the details of your main graphic. Pause again. Questions are fun, but you have to give people a chance to ask them.

When pausing, use the "Take a sip of water" technique. Stop talking. Imagine that you are reaching for a class of water, lifting it up, taking a sip, and putting it back down. Only after that can you assume that there are no questions.

Sadly, you will sometimes be stuck with an audience too shy to ask questions. That is OK! One of the things you are learning in this class is how to handle different sorts of audiences. To handle a shy audience, you need to have prepared ahead of time 5 minutes worth of things to talk about. This can, and should, include a tour of your Github repository,

### When Listening

Always allow the student you are listening to to give their opening paragraph, perhaps even allowing them a second paragraph to explain their plot. But then interrupt them and ask a question. It doesn't really matter what the question is. The important thing is to get a conversation going, to demonstrate to guests that questions are welcome and that they should ask some as well.

Check out the spreadsheet to see which student presentations you are likely to attend. Check out the webpages and Github repos ahead of time. Learn a little bit about the topics. The more you prepare, the better an audience you will be.

Note that, in larger classes, we (conceptually) break up Demo Day into smaller collections which combine the students from two TFs together. This means that your TF (and her students) and another TF (and his students) are together, only using breakout rooms 22 to 28, for example. This means that, after you listen to the presentation in room 28, you don't go to 29, you go back to room 22, the first room assigned to your collection.
